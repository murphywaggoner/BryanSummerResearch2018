require(knitr)
source("Anne_Data_1_Read.R")
source("Anne_Data_2_Clean.R")
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Setup chunck

The setup chunk above reads in, executes, but does not echo the code in the R scripts `Anne_Data_1_Read.R` and `Anne_Data_2_Read.R`.  You need those two files in the same folder as this Rmd file and as the `Annedata.xlsx` file.

## Gathering in Order to Facet_wrap

This plot gathers the tibble into a taller tibble.  All of the columns that start with "therapy" are gathered into one column called `therapy`.  Frankly, I don't know what purpose the `value = "DSAge"` parameter serves.

```{r}


DSSurvey %>% 
  gather(key = "therapy", value = "DSAge", matches("^therapy") ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = visitstotal, y = income)) + 
  geom_jitter() +
  facet_wrap(~ therapy)

```
